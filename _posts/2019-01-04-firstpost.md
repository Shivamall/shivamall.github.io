## [Swift]({% post_url 2019-01-04-firstpost %})

I Have chosen Swift Language to make my project because it will help me to learn some basics which will help me on my fourth term. Although, my previous experience was with Android Native App and those time i dont have the tools to learn developing ios app. So, That's why i chose this topic.
I am going to develope basic chatting app with help of firebase.

### Features Of Chatting App:
* User Sign UP and Login Page.
* SignUp or Login with Google.
* Real Time chatting.
* I will try to develope notification feature.
